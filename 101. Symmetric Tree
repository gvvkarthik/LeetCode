# üîÑ Symmetric Tree

## **üìå Problem Statement**  
Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

### **üîπ Example 1:**  
```python
Input: root = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3]  
Output: true  
Explanation: The tree is symmetric:
        1
       / \
      2   2
     / \ / \
    3  4 4  3
```

### **üîπ Example 2:**  
```python
Input: root = [1, 2, 2, None, 3, None, 3]  
Output: false  
Explanation: The tree is not symmetric:
        1
       / \
      2   2
       \   \
        3   3
```

## **üöÄ Solution Approach**  
1. A tree is symmetric if the left and right subtrees are mirror images of each other.
2. We can recursively check if the left and right subtrees are symmetric by comparing their nodes.  
3. Base cases: 
    - If both subtrees are empty, they are symmetric.
    - If one subtree is empty and the other is not, they are not symmetric.
4. Recursively check the symmetry by comparing the values of the nodes and their respective subtrees.

## **üìù Python Code (Symmetric Tree)**  
```python
class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        if not root:
            return True

        queue = deque([(root.left, root.right)])

        while queue:
            t1, t2 = queue.popleft()

            if not t1 and not t2:
                continue
            if not t1 or not t2 or t1.val != t2.val:
                return False

            queue.append((t1.left, t2.right))
            queue.append((t1.right, t2.left))

        return True

```

## **‚è≥ Time & Space Complexity**  
‚úÖ **Time Complexity:** `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node once.  
‚úÖ **Space Complexity:** `O(H)`, where `H` is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursive call stack.
